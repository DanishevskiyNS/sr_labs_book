# ITMO Speaker Recognition Course

**Authors:** Volokhov V., Lavrentyeva G., Novoselov S., Matveev Y.

The project is related to the development of labs for the ITMO Speaker Recognition Course.

**Keywords:** voice biometrics, speaker recognition, acoustic features, speech activity detector, speaker embedding extractor, decision theory, domain adaptation and calibration.

**Datasets:** the main databases for performing of labs is [VoxCeleb corpus](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/).
