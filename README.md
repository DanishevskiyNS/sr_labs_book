# ITMO Speaker Recognition Course

**Authors:** Volokhov V., Lavrentyeva G., Novoselov S., Matveev Y.

The project is related to the development of labs for the ITMO Speaker Recognition Course.

**Keywords:** voice biometrics, speaker recognition, acoustic features, speech activity detector, speaker embedding extractor, decision theory, domain adaptation and calibration.

**Datasets:** the main databases for performing of labs is [VoxCeleb corpus](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/).

**Content:** the repository contains materials for self-performing five labs. The titles of the labs are listed below.

- Lab work 1. Informative features of speech signals: feature extraction.
- Lab work 2. Voice activity detector training.
- Lab work 3. Creating and comparing speaker models.
- Lab work 4. Decision criteria and quality metrics.
- Lab work 5. Adaptation and calibration of speaker recognition systems.

Some ideas for creating of labs were borrowed [here](https://github.com/clovaai/voxceleb_trainer).
